# Drupal template for Flexible Web Publisher (FWP) on Platform.sh

This project provides a starter kit for Drupal projects hosted on by Flexible Web Publisher on Platform.sh. It is primarily an example, although could be used as the starting point for a real project. It is built using Composer, via drupal/core-recommended script.

This template has been consciously build to allow FWP users not to worry about ssh setup to deploy their application and manage it from their Drupal backend only.
